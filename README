asyv6-0.1 -- IPv{I don't care} connect() API

Libeasyv6-0.1 provides connecbyname() and listenbyname() functions which
facilitate writing IPv{I don't care} applications. These functions
efficiently connect to whatever IPv4 or IPv6 addresses associated with
a given name that they can. Where connections to an address don't promptly
respond, additional addresses are tried in parallel rather than waiting for
the first address to time out. In principle the APIs are forward-compatible
with future transport protocols which support small-site multihoming by
shifting between different IP addresses at each end of the connection in
response to network conditions.
