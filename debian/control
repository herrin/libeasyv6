 .
 In addition to making it relatively easy to write applications which
 inherently support TCP via both IPv4 and IPv6, LibEasyV6 is intended to
 be "future proof." A new layer 4 transport protocol could be implemented
 which jumps between multiple IP addresses during the connection. Such a
 protocol might rely on the host name to tie the connection together. It 
 would  remain fully compatible with the libeasyv6 API. Simply swap in a new
 library and your application will automatically work with the new
 protocol, without even recompiling it.
